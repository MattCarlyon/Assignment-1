    <h1>Matt Carlyon - Project Portfolio</h1>
    <br>
    <p><b>Welcome to my project portfolio page.</b></p>
    <p>Within this site i will display my progress while on the IT: Front-end Developer VT 23 course.</p>
    <p><i>Here it is, progress on day 1's first assignment (above). I've set up a HTML file, entered code and formatted the text. 
        The next thing is to figure out Git and GitHub.</i></p>
    <p><i>Day 2 has been about linking the code in Visual Studio Code with a GitHub repository and navigating GitBash. 
        GitBash is a kind of document control software that allows people to creat their own branches of the master file to work independantly and tracking changes.</i></p>

    <!--change the above desciption and formatting later, need better skills first!-->
